      I never expected ICT to be this hard. I remember hating it in the first week because of the hands-on activities. I am 
      incapable of coding a whole website with all the attributes and all the bling in 45 minutes. I type like what? 10 words
      a minute. It was not easy, and it was frustrating. But as weeks went by, and as more hands-on activities were done, I 
      learned that I wasn't incapable, and my slow typing wasn't really a problem. I find it fun now. It's hard, and I have 
      every right to hate it. The time pressure was real, but it isn't Ms. Uminga's faultâ€”that's just how it works. So, I learned
      to be better and practiced more just so I could keep up and finish all the performance tasks that were given. The mistakes
      I made were a learning curve, and I learned a lot, not just about the lessons but also about myself. I learned that I'm capable 
      of doing things that can make me better at this subject and in other subjects too. I love a subject that teaches me more than the 
      lesson it has on the MELC; I love it when it teaches me to improve and reminds me of what I can really do. I most certainly love it when 
      I learn things from it that make me a better student and a better person.  </p>
