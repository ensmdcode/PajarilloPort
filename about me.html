      Venice here! There's a lot to know about me, but for now, 
      I'll introduce how I am as a student of Las Pi√±as City 
      National Science High School (LPSci). 
      Let's start with my top 3 favorite subjects: </br> </br>
        FILIPINO </br>
        This is not a subject I perform best in but this is 
        the subject where I can be the most creative. I'm a PAHAM 
        club member and officer since I was in grade 7. Honestly, 
        this subject isn't easy and sometimes can be challenging 
        but there's no beeter feeling than learning things that's 
        related to a country that you came from.</br>
        SCIENCE </br>
        This is one of the most interesting and enjoyable subject 
        ever. I love it when I really learn things, and in this 
        subject I've learned a lot. It's amazing to study things 
        such as biology, chemistry and physics. I admit that it's
        hard but that's the reason why its fun. Learning hard things
        makes me feel good about myself.</br>
        MATH/BASIC CALCULUS/ICT </br>
        Okay, I'll pit these three together. Math and bas cal 
        are hard, math has never been easy but as I said, when 
        it's hard but figurable, it's fun. Once I get grasp of 
        the formula, It's actually fun to solve and it makes me 
        look smart so... And I can say the same with Ict. At first, 
        ICT is hard but figurable and I look smart everytime I code. 
        I guess I put these three together because I have the same 
        way how I figure it out. First I'll striggle and hate the 
        whole thing, second, ill figure it out slowly, third I'll love it. </br> </br>
      Now a little more background about how I am as a stident: 
      I'll say that I can perform above average when it comes to academics. 
      Ive been an academic achiever since elementary and I also do journalism. 
      In fact, I'm PAHAM club member and officer since  grade 7. Ive joined DSPC 
      when I was in grade 7&8 and won 4th olace the first time I joined as a Lapiscian. 
      I'm still practicing to be better at my category and I'm hoping to olace first this 
      SY if given the chance. 

      Outside academics, I have far too many interest. I barely base intelligent on 
      academics that's why the things I do outside it, are more important for me. I 
      have a big interest in literatures of any kind and I'm starting to learn more about 
      them. I do have a few hobbies and play some instrument.
